Menubar Weather is available [here](https://github.com/Nathan1258/Menubar-Weather/releases/) where you can use your own [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com) key to use the app for free, or the app is available on the Mac App Store where you'll have to pay a small fee to integrate with Apple Weather for a realtime 7-day forecast plus lots of other features!
